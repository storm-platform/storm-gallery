Description: This package is the materialization of a Research Compendium (RC), 
       created based on the annotations made by Marwick et al. <10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986>. 
       In the RC, a complete application is available in which the detection of deforested areas 
       in the Amazon rainforest is performed. To detect deforested areas, the classification of 
       time series extracted from cubes of fraction images is applied. The classification is done 
       with Machine Learning algorithms. The Linear Spectral Mixture Model is used to generate 
       the fraction images.
